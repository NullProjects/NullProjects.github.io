#Null Projects Github Website
URL: http://nullprojects.github.io

This is the main Null Projects Open Source End Community Website using github features such as loging into github amongst other things.

Null Projects is the back end group to a new and growing software development firm that is main focus on video game creation. While
these projects will be of the propriatary nature there will be some open source projects that will be listed along this website as well
as the projects of propriatary nature. This will be the main listing of open source projects as well such as the back end to some of the
propriatary video games made such as server software, engine builds... things to further the advancement and learning process of the
video game development industry.

This website is free to use though if anyone wish to use it, a bit of a complex and different setup than what I usually go with but here
at github there are practices that I want to start putting into practice when I make things. There will be different themes and such as well
and different set up processes for the website layouts in general which I will keep in a marked folder under this master branch and they
will be avalible for use by anyone who wishes to use them even the graphics.
